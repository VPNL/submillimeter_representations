# `figures/`
All python code responsible for helping make figures can be found here. Additionally, a description of how each figure was made, whether with scripts in this directory or not, is provided.

`figures_misc` contains figures that were generated with code in the `analyses` directory, whereas `python_outputs` houses figures generated by the python scripts in this directory.

For convenience, statistics related to each figure are printed when that figure is generated.

## Figure 1
##### Experimental design
Images come directly from the fLoc stimulus set described in [Stigliani et al., 2015](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/35/36/12412.short) and [linked online](http://vpnl.stanford.edu/fLoc/). They are copied to `figures_misc/figure_1_images/` for convenience.

## Figure 2
##### Visualization of likely veins and ROI definitions on the cortical surface of a representative participant's right-hemisphere VTC
EPI images are generated from `analyses/03a_epi_maps_redoutline/main.m`, the participant shown is S1, (FSID: C1051). The raw images for each depth are copied to `figures_misc/figure_2_images/` for convenience.

## Figure 3
##### Validation of the Fourier-based smoothing method for simulating 2.4mm acquisitions
- Panels A, C: outputs from `analyses/04_maps/main.m` and are compiled with `figure_3ac_3t_zscore_maps.py`
- Panel B: RSMs are generated with `figure_3b_rdm_comparison.py`

## Figure 4
##### Category preference maps in VTC shown on the inflated cortical surface of participant S1
Panel A: `figure_4a_zscore_maps.py`: right hemisphere only for all 10 categories
Panel B: `figure_4b_zscore_maps_both_hemis.py`: both hemispheres shown across depth for a single category

## Figure 5
##### Hypothetical representational structures
`figures/figure_5.py`

## Figure 6
##### Group-averaged RDMs, RSMs, and MDS embeddings in each ROI
`figures/figure_6_group_average_rdms.py`

## Figure 7
##### Fitting RDMs with model RDMs
Panel A: `figures/figure_7a_rdm_fit_diagram.py`: schematic of how RDMs are fit with a real example
Panel B: `figures/figure_7b_rdm_fits.py`: RDM fits scatter plot

## Figure 8
##### Representational structure varies with cortical depth
Panels A-F: `figures/figure_8af_average_rdms_by_depth.py`: Plots RDMs for each depth and ROI 
Panels G and H: `figures/figure_8gh_rdm_fits_by_depth.py`: RDM fits and summary statistics across depth (10x10 RDMs)

## Figure 9
##### Representational structure across domains
`figures/figure_9_rdm_fits_by_domain.py`: Plots mean within-category and between-category dissimilarity for each VTC partition, domain, and depth

## Figure 10 
##### Signal properties across depth
Panel A and B: `figure_10ab_tsnr_R2.py` plots the mean tSNR and R^2 across subjects for each depth and VTC partition
Panel C: `figure_10c_metric_means.py` plots the ROI-average percent signal change for each depth and each category for lateral and medial VTC

## Figure 11
##### Comparison of representational structure of VTC at ultra-high-resolution and standard- resolution
`figure_11_rescomp.py` plots rdms and rdm fits for the high-resolution, low-resolution, and noise-added low resolution data

## Figure 12
##### Comparison of GLM metrics
`figure_12_metric_comparison.py` plots rdms and rdm fits for six different metrics one could compute

## Figure 12
##### Comparison of GLM metrics
`figure_12_metric_comparison.py` plots rdms and rdm fits for six different metrics one could compute
